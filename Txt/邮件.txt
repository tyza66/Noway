	Helloï¼ŒI'm a player of your game "FIE Swordplay".We found some problems with your game.
	When I selected the player as Chinese, there was a "kneel down" action in the failed CG.  But in Chinese people's eyes, kneeling is a very solemn act.Chinese people will not kneel to anyone unless they are offering sacrifices or respecting their elders.  Some people give your game a lower review in the app store for this reason.  
	So I would like you to make changes in this area.We hope that when we choose China, the failed CG will not just be the kneel or cancel the kneel.
	Thank you for reading, and I hope you can take my advice to delete or downplay the Chinese kneeling.
